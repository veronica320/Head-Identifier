# Head-Identifier
This is a tool to identify the head of a phrase (e.g. "water" in "boiling hot water"). 

It's part of the event extraction system proposed in our ACL2021 paper: [Zero-shot Event Extraction via Transfer Learning: Challenges and Insights](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.42/). Feel free to check the [repo of the paper](https://github.com/veronica320/Zeroshot-Event-Extraction) as well!

Code coming soon!
